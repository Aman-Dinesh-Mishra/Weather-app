# Weather-app--HTML,CSS & Javascript
Building a weather app utilizes a variety of concepts which helps us to understand the intricacies of the application.
-> The use of API is necessary inorder to build 
   an up-to-date application. It is helpful for 
   accumulating the data with regards to 
   different parameters related to weather.
-> JavaScript works as a backend by updating
   the data viz. Temparature,Wind speed & 
   humidity.
-> API key helps the frontend of the code 
   to hit the backend server and return the 
   output from the backend.This makes the 
   application useful across different time 
   zones & continents, providing the weather 
   details of the cities without providing 
   the input of the country.
